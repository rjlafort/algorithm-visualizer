# Algorithm Visualizer 
A desktop application written in C++ and Qt which aims to provide a clear visual of different algorithms and hopefully demystify some of their behaviors.

Currently offers visualizations for "DFS" and "BFS", and will most likely be rewritten in Qt Quick before I add any more.
